# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Python. The player competes against the computer in this classic hand game.

## How It Works

- The player selects one of three options: **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- The game determines the winner based on the rules:
  - **Rock** beats **Scissors**
  - **Scissors** beats **Paper**
  - **Paper** beats **Rock**
  - If both select the same option, it's a tie.

The player can continue playing multiple rounds until they decide to quit.
